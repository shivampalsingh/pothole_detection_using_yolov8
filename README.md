YOLOv8 Segmentation with DeepSORT Object Tracking(ID + Trails) </H1>

## Google Colab File Link (A Single Click Solution)
The google colab file link for yolov8 segmentation and tracking is provided below, you can check the implementation in Google Colab, and its a single click implementation
,you just need to select the Run Time as GPU, and click on Run All.
